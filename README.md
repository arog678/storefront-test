# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Brief

You’ve been asked to create a simple product details section for a clothing site with cart functionality to store a customer’s product selections. The clothing site will comprise a client-side app in Javascript, HTML, CSS.

A T-shirt is displayed on a product page and it has various sizes which a customer can purchase. Images for the Product Screen and Mini-Cart are attached to give you an idea of how this is visualised in the app. Further details are provided in the design prototype

# Requirements

- A web page is provided based on the design prototype. You do NOT have to be “pixel-perfect”, we would recommend trying to meet the basic design details.
Responsive web design. The site needs to fit the different sizes of the user’s screen. Only large desktop and mobile designs are provided. You need to fill in the blank on what the page looks like in between.
- A customer can add a product with selected options (size) to a cart.
    - When the page is first loaded there is no size selected.
    - Successfully adding a product to the cart will populate this sized product in the mini cart section.
    - Clicking Add to Cart without the size option selected will show an error message.
    - There should only be one row for each product size selected within the mini cart. Quantities will be updated as the product is added multiple times.
    - Add to Cart button on hover colour changes, apply a 0.2-second transition to animate this.
- A customer can view a mini-cart of their selections
- Product information will be consumed from the Product API: HTTP GET https://3sb655pz3a.execute-api.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/live/product

# Beyond Scope
- Localization for pricing
- Meta tag + SEO code
